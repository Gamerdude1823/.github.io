      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The website I want to build is a website about me. I think that the best website I can create for myself is a resume website. This website will allow me to seem presentable to my prospective bosses as well as show off my skill as a programmer. This will also act a sort of portfolio of my web design skills. This will allow me to show off my skills to anyone that asks. Why not create a website that can better my potential employment efforts once I graduate school here at BYU-I?</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience would be the potetial employers of mine or others that might want to see what I can do professionally. It will also be so that i can present myself in a more professional manner. </p>  <!-- change this -->
